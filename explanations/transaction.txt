This transaction script sets up an NFT collection for an account if it doesn't already have one. First, it checks whether the account already has a collection stored at a specific path (ExampleNFT.CollectionStoragePath). If a collection exists, the transaction exits early to avoid duplication. If no collection exists, it creates a new empty collection using the ExampleNFT.createEmptyCollection function. The newly created collection is saved into the account's storage at the specified path.

Next, the script issues a capability for the collection, which allows other accounts or contracts to interact with it securely. This capability is published at a public path (ExampleNFT.CollectionPublicPath), making it accessible to external entities. The transaction completes with a log message indicating that the account setup process is finished.
